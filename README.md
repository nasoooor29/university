# Nasoooor's University journey

This GitHub repository will document every step I take in the university, and it will include all the labs answers. It will be a useful reference for students who are studying the same topics and who want to understand the concepts better.

I will use Markdown to create files in this repository, as it is easy to read and is widely supported by GitHub. Each lab will have its own file, where I will write a brief summary of the topics discussed, any special instructions given, and then provide my answers to the lab questions.

In addition, I will include any additional files that are necessary, such as code examples or data files. I will also add any supplementary material I have found to help me better understand the topics covered in the labs.

Finally, I will use this repository to track my progress in the university, by writing summaries of the topics I have studied and adding notes of any insights I have gained. This way, I will have a better understanding of the material, and I will also be able to go back and review any topics I have missed or forgotten.
