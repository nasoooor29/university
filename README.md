# Nasoooor's University journey

This GitHub repository will document every step I take in the university, and it will include all the labs answers. It will be a useful reference for students who are studying the same topics and who want to understand the concepts better.

The root folder structure will contain the year's in university, and then it would split into three semesters sem1 sem2 summer then every class will have it's folder
**Example**
```
Year 1
  Semester 1
    Class 1
    Class 2
    Class 3
    
  Semester 2
    Class 1
    Class 2
    Class 3
    
  Summer Semester
```

All of the lecture notes, assignments, and projects will be organized into this folders, so they can be easily accessed. 

In addition, I will include any additional files that are necessary, such as code examples or data files. I will also add any supplementary material I have found to help me better understand the topics covered in the labs.

Finally, I will use this repository to track my progress in the university, by writing summaries of the topics I have studied and adding notes of any insights I have gained. This way, I will have a better understanding of the material, and I will also be able to go back and review any topics I have missed or forgotten.
